## Features

#### Schedule 
The Schedule section of the homepage provides users with quick and easy access to essential information about upcoming lessons. Knowing a club's schedule is often one of the first things a prospective student looks for. With this feature, users can plan their visits, attend trial classes, and make informed decisions about their training commitments.

Those images mentioned above are insterted as "background-image" since i had more editing flexibility doing it that way.
The drawback to that is not having an "alt" text. I found an article mentioning a work-around as can be seen here below.

It doesn't pass the W3C test though but I do believe it's better with any text than none.

## Deployment
